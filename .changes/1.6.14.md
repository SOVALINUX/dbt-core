## dbt-core 1.6.14 - May 02, 2024

### Features

- Move flags from UserConfig in profiles.yml to flags in dbt_project.yml ([#9183](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/9183))
- Add require_explicit_package_overrides_for_builtin_materializations to dbt_project.yml flags, which can be used to opt-out of overriding built-in materializations from packages ([#10007](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/10007))

### Fixes

- Replace usage of `Set` with `List` to fix issue with index updates intermittently happening out of order ([#72](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/72))

### Under the Hood

- Raise deprecation warning if installed package overrides built-in materialization ([#9971](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/9971))
- Remove the final underscore from secret environment variable constants. ([#10052](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/10052))
